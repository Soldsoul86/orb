/**
 * A spend receipt: evidence that does not ask to be trusted.
 *
 * Most audit trails are an assertion. *"Our system authorised this; here is
 * our log."* A reader who does not already trust the issuer learns nothing
 * from it, because the log and the claim have the same author.
 *
 * A receipt here is different, and the difference is the whole point of
 * everything under it being pure and deterministic: it carries the request,
 * the policy, and the ledger the decision was made against — so **a reader
 * can re-run the decision themselves and check it comes out the same.** Not
 * "trust my answer" but "here is the input and the rule; compute it yourself."
 *
 * That property is only available because `evaluate` reads no clock, performs
 * no I/O and consults nothing global. Determinism is usually defended as a
 * testing convenience. This is what it is actually for.
 *
 * ## The redaction trade-off, stated rather than hidden
 *
 * Full recomputation needs the ledger as it stood at decision time, and that
 * ledger contains other transactions. For a self-audit or a regulator that is
 * fine. For a receipt handed to a counterparty it may not be — you would be
 * disclosing your other spending to prove one payment.
 *
 * So both `policy` and `ledgerContext` may be omitted. A redacted receipt
 * still proves a great deal: that the events hash to their own contents, that
 * the outcome matches them, that the decision names a specific policy by
 * digest. It simply cannot prove the decision was *correct*. `verifyReceipt`
 * reports exactly which checks it could and could not perform — a verifier
 * that quietly downgraded would be worse than one that refuses.
