/**
 * The ledger as a projection of the Event Journal.
 *
 * Constitution Art. I §3: the journal is the single source of truth and
 * everything else is a derived projection that may be discarded and rebuilt.
 * Until now this package held its ledger in a `Map` and called it a source of
 * truth — a violation of its own constitution, and the reason a reservation
 * could not survive a restart.
 *
 * Here the ledger is what it should always have been: a fold over three kinds
 * of immutable fact.
 *
 *   payment.reserved   this much was committed, by this requester, at this time
 *   payment.settled    this much was actually spent
 *   payment.reversed   it provably did not happen
 *
 * Three consequences fall out for free:
 *
 * - **A restart resumes.** `open` replays the journal and rebuilds the budget
 *   exactly, because the fold is deterministic (Art. II §9).
 * - **Devices share a budget.** Replicated lanes carry the same facts, and
 *   `orderEvents` puts them in HLC order, so two devices spending from one
 *   envelope converge instead of double-counting (Art. IV §18).
 * - **Reconciliation is a fold, not a special case.** An open reservation is
 *   simply a `reserved` with no matching `settled` or `reversed`.
 *
 * Amounts are written as decimal strings. `canonicalJson` refuses `bigint`,
 * which is the correct refusal — JSON has no unambiguous encoding for one —
 * and a lossy `Number` in a money ledger is exactly the bug this package
 * exists to avoid.
