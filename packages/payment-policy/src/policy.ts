/**
 * What a policy is.
 *
 * A policy is **data**, not code: a versioned list of rules that can be
 * serialized, hashed, journalled and replayed. Rules are a discriminated union
 * rather than an interface with implementations, so adding a rule kind is an
 * addition to a type — the compiler then names every place that must handle it
 * (Constitution Art. X §37: the kernel evolves through addition).
 *
 * Every rule carries a scope. A rule with no scope applies to everyone, which
 * is the only sane default for a limit: forgetting to scope a rule must mean
 * "applies to all", never "applies to none".
