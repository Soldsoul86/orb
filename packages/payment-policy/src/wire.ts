/**
 * The one encoding everything hashes and signs over.
 *
 * Three modules needed "canonical bytes for this object" and two of them had
 * grown their own copy. Art. IX §33 — never duplicate a source of truth —
 * applies to an encoding as much as to data: two encoders that agree today
 * will disagree after one of them is edited, and then a signature made by one
 * fails under the other for no visible reason.
 *
 * Amounts become decimal strings because `canonicalJson` refuses `bigint`,
 * and it is right to. JSON has no unambiguous encoding for one, and a
 * `Number` would silently round a large payment into a lie.
 *
 * ## RFC 8785 (JCS)
 *
 * This encoding **conforms** to the JSON Canonicalization Scheme, which
 * several payment protocols mandate by name: keys ordered by UTF-16 code unit,
 * numbers in the ECMAScript `Number::toString` forms, no incidental
 * whitespace, and NaN/Infinity refused rather than encoded.
 *
 * That is measured, not asserted — `tests/jcs.test.ts` runs the RFC's own
 * §3.2.3 worked example, the surrogate-pair ordering case, and the number
 * forms the RFC calls out.
 *
 * It is worth saying how that fact was arrived at, because the process was
 * worse than the result. Non-conformance was listed as a known limitation for
 * several revisions, on nothing but an assumption. When somebody finally
 * checked, it already conformed on every point. A limitation recorded without
 * being measured is a guess in the costume of a known issue, and this one cost
 * interop credibility for nothing.
 *
 * The one narrowing is `toWire`: a `bigint` becomes a decimal string *before*
 * canonicalisation. That decides what JSON value is being encoded, which is a
 * question JCS does not answer and does not forbid. A counterparty must be
 * told amounts are strings; they need not be told anything about JCS.
