/**
 * The engine.
 *
 * Pure: no I/O, no clock, no randomness, no mutation of its inputs. The same
 * request, policy and ledger always produce a byte-identical decision, which
 * is what lets a decision be journalled once and re-derived forever
 * (Constitution Art. I §4, Art. II §9).
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing, and each exists because the alternative
 * fails in a way that costs money:
 *
 * - **Deny by default.** No policy, no matching rule, an unrecognised account:
 *   all deny. An authorization system whose failure mode is "allow" is not an
 *   authorization system.
 * - **Every rule is evaluated, not just the first to fail.** Art. II §10
 *   requires that a decision be explainable; a decision that names one
 *   tripped limit while hiding the four it passed cannot be audited, and
 *   cannot tell an operator how close the others came.
 * - **Evaluation is idempotent.** The request under evaluation is excluded
 *   from its own ledger, so re-running a decision for an in-flight request
 *   returns the same answer instead of counting the request against itself.
