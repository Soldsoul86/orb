/**
 * A Poseidon Merkle tree, built to match the circuit exactly.
 *
 * `@orb/payment-policy` commits with SHA-256, which is right for a commitment
 * people verify on a CPU and wrong for one verified inside a circuit: a
 * SHA-256 compression is tens of thousands of constraints, and a 32-leaf tree
 * would need hundreds of them. Poseidon is designed for the field and costs
 * a couple of hundred.
 *
 * So the tree is rebuilt here rather than reused, and the two must agree on
 * *shape* even though they disagree on hash. The circuit is the specification:
 *
 * - the tree is **perfect** — exactly `2^depth` leaves, zero-filled;
 * - a leaf is `Poseidon(account, asset, index, total)`, carrying its own key
 *   so it cannot be lifted into another commitment;
 * - a node is `Poseidon(left, right)`;
 * - position `i`'s path directions are the bits of `i`, which are constants
 *   in the circuit and therefore not something a prover can choose.
 *
 * That last property is why completeness needs no separate check here: every
 * position exists, and each is verified where it sits.
