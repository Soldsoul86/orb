/**
 * @orb/payment-circuit — a Groth16 proof that a payment stayed inside a
 * private budget.
 *
 * Separate from `@orb/payment-policy` on purpose. A proving system is a large,
 * opinionated dependency, and the package that decides whether payments are
 * allowed must stay free of it: the engine has to run anywhere, offline, with
 * nothing installed. Proving is an optional capability layered on top, which
 * is the same reason model providers live behind ports rather than in the
 * kernel.
