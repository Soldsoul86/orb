# Tests — @orb/payment-circuit

`npm test -w @orb/payment-circuit`

Proving tests **skip themselves** when `artifacts/` has not been built, so a
fresh clone still runs a green suite. `npm run circuit` produces them.

## Encoding (`field.test.ts`)

Identifiers are deterministic, separate different inputs, and **always land
inside the field** — checked for the empty string, an emoji and a 5,000
character input, because a map that fails on an edge case is a map that fails
in production.

Amounts accept the whole 64-bit range and refuse anything above it, including
`FIELD_MODULUS - 1` — the value that would wrap the field and read as small
inside the circuit. Negatives and unsafe timestamps are refused.

## The tree (`tree.test.ts`)

Runs without artifacts, so it stays fast and catches the drift that matters
most: if the tree and the circuit ever disagree on leaf construction or path
ordering, the result is a valid-looking proof of the wrong statement.

The root moves for a changed total, the same total in a different bucket, a
different account, a different asset, and a different base index. The path test
**walks a path by hand using the bits of the index**, mirroring `MerklePath` in
the circuit, and checks it reaches the root.

## Proving (`prove.test.ts`)

**True statements** prove and verify — including at exactly the limit, and
against an empty ledger.

**False statements cannot be proved at all.** Not "produce an invalid proof
that a verifier rejects": the witness is unsatisfiable and `proveBudget`
throws. Tested for an overspend and for a single bucket that blows the limit.

**A valid proof is still about specific values.** The same sound proof fails
verification against a different claimed limit, a different claimed amount, a
different ledger, or a tampered public signal — otherwise the commitments bind
nothing.

**What the verifier sees, and does not.** Exactly four field elements, each
checked by value against the commitment it is supposed to be: `policyCommit`,
`requestCommit`, `bucketRoot`, `baseIndex`. The limit, the amount and every
bucket total are inputs to a Poseidon hash and never values on the wire, which
is asserted by checking that no public signal **equals** any of them. Two
different ledgers under the same limit produce the same policy commitment and
different ledger commitments.

> **This assertion used to be wrong, and randomly so.** It grepped the
> serialised proof for the decimal strings `"10000"`, `"3000"`, `"4000"`,
> `"2000"`. A Groth16 proof is **857 decimal digits** of uniformly random field
> elements — measured, not estimated — so a given four-digit string turns up by
> chance about **8%** of the time, and across the four secrets about **23%** of
> runs failed for no reason connected to secrecy. It also proved nothing when
> it passed: a secret does not leak as a decimal substring of a random group
> element, it leaks as a public signal. Absence of a substring is not absence
> of a value. The replacement is deterministic and about the right property.

## What is *not* covered

- **The trusted setup.** Development ceremony; its security properties are
  stated in the README, not tested, because they do not hold.
- **Rules other than the window budget.** Allowlists, velocity and approvals
  are not in the circuit; each would be its own statement.
- **Proving performance.** No threshold is asserted because none has been
  agreed; asserting an arbitrary one would be theatre.
