/**
 * A receipt you can check without trusting whoever gave it to you.
 *
 *   node scripts/receipt.mjs
 *
 * An agent pays for an API call. The issuer hands you a receipt. You do not
 * work for the issuer and you have no access to their systems — all you have
 * is the file. Can you tell whether the payment was actually authorised?
 *
 * With an ordinary audit log: no. The log and the claim have the same author.
 * Here: yes, because the receipt carries the request, the rule and the ledger,
 * and the decision engine is deterministic. You re-run it yourself.
