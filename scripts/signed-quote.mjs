/**
 * Who promised this?
 *
 *   node scripts/signed-quote.mjs
 *
 * A quote already proves *what* was promised — its contents hash, and editing
 * them is caught. It does not prove *who* promised it: anyone can mint a quote
 * claiming to be your vendor, and nothing in the quote objects.
 *
 * Signing closes that. But the interesting scene is the third one, because it
 * is the failure real systems ship: a signature that is cryptographically
 * perfect, made by a key with no right to the name on the payload.
