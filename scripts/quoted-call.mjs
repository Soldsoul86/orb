/**
 * The whole exchange, both sides.
 *
 *   node scripts/quoted-call.mjs
 *
 * An agent asks a service for something. The service answers "not until you
 * pay", with a quote: a ceiling, an expiry, and what it is for. The agent
 * checks that ceiling against its own policy *before* committing, pays, and
 * gets a receipt that proves both parties behaved.
 *
 * The point is the third scene. Without a quote, the agent authorises a guess
 * and a call that runs long simply wins. With one, the unknown sits with the
 * party that actually knows it, and a seller that charges past its own
 * ceiling is caught rather than absorbed.
