# allowance

You gave an AI agent an API key, a wallet, or a card. This is what stops it
from spending more than you meant, and proves afterwards exactly what it spent
and why.

You write the limits as data: how much per call, how much per day, which
vendors, which hours, who has to approve, what has to be true first. The agent
asks; the policy decides; every decision is written to an append-only ledger
that survives crashes and can be replayed. Anyone you hand a receipt to can
re-run the decision themselves and check it comes out the same.

> A payment may be requested by anyone. **Spend authority belongs to the policy.**

Programmable spend authority for AI agents, published on npm under the
`@spendcap` scope.

| Package | |
| --- | --- |
| [`@spendcap/policy`](packages/policy) | Rules, guard, ledger, receipts, quotes, signing, x402 transport |
| [`@spendcap/journal`](packages/journal) | Append-only, hash-chained history. Zero dependencies |
| [`@spendcap/circuit`](packages/circuit) | Prove a spend stayed inside a budget without revealing the budget |
| [`@spendcap/anthropic`](packages/anthropic) | The Anthropic SDK behind the guard: swap one import, every call is decided, reserved and settled |
| [`@spendcap/x402`](packages/x402) | x402 behind the guard: the policy decides before anything is signed, and a retry pays once |
| [`@spendcap/x402-conformance`](packages/x402-conformance) | Seven properties any x402 client must satisfy when it cannot tell whether the money moved |

```bash
npm install @spendcap/policy
```

```bash
npm install && npm run build
npm run check      # exercises every claim above against the built output
```

[`examples/`](examples) holds twelve situations with the exact policy that handles
each; `npm run examples` runs them all.

**Releasing.** Bump the version of each package that changed, and the pin in
any sibling that depends on it, then push a tag:

```bash
git tag v0.1.1 && git push origin v0.1.1
```

The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) runs the check and the
examples on that commit, publishes every package whose version is not on npm
yet in dependency order, and writes a GitHub release. It signs in to npm with
a short-lived token from GitHub, so there is no npm token anywhere.
`node release.mjs --dry-run` shows what a tag would publish.

There is no test suite. [`check.mjs`](check.mjs) is one file that states each
property the packages claim, runs it, and exits non-zero if it does not hold.
Read it before believing the READMEs.
