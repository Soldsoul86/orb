## AD-1 — A `Claim` layer between Evidence and Fact

- **Status:** Open · **Raised:** Phase 3b, Knowledge domain review · **Revisit at:**
  before Orb **v2** (not v1)
- **Domain:** Knowledge · **Kind (if adopted):** State

**Question.** Should the epistemic stack gain a `Claim` object between Evidence and
Fact?

```
Observation → Evidence → Claim → Fact → Belief
```

**Why it might be needed.** *Claims* are what people (and external sources) actually
assert — statements that are neither runtime Facts nor runtime Beliefs:

- "John likes Rust."
- "BTC will reach $250k."
- "The meeting was successful."

These are not Facts (the runtime has not settled them on evidence) and not Beliefs
(they are not the runtime's own contextual interpretation). They are **asserted by
someone**, and over time become **supported**, **contradicted**, or **unresolved**.
A `Claim` would let Orb *ingest the world's statements* without prematurely
classifying them as Fact or Belief — a cleaner intake path for second-hand or
disputed assertions.

**Why deferred.** v1 can represent an external assertion as an Observation (someone
said X) plus Evidence, and let interpretation form Facts/Beliefs from there. The
`Claim` abstraction is a clarity and ergonomics gain, not a correctness gap, so it
does not justify expanding the v1 kernel. Adding it later is purely additive under
Constitution Article X (v1 contracts remain valid forever).

**Leading option.** Introduce `Claim` as a Knowledge-domain State contract in v2,
depending on `Evidence` (and naming the asserting source identity, as Observation
does). It would carry a resolution status (`supported | contradicted | unresolved`)
and be referenced by Facts/Beliefs that adopt or reject it. To be evaluated against
the simpler "external assertion = Observation + Evidence" baseline before adoption.

**Decision owner:** reviewer (architecture). **Resolution:** record an explicit
accept/reject with rationale at the v2 kernel boundary.
